Instructions:
the following information describes an epidemiological model called SEIAQFR.
based on the information provided, program the set of ordinary differential equations described using python and any library that is necessary which includes but is not limited to:
1. numpy
2. diffeqpy
3. matplotlib

- this program should include code that is able to run in a .ipynb file, commonly called "Jupyter Notebook".

- the ultimate purpose of this model is too:
1. predict disease characteristics
2. impose containtment
3. control and mitigate probably outbreaks through prediction


The model:
this model identifies 7 individual "classes" in a population when modelling a epidemic:
1. susceptible (S): individuals of total population (N) who are exposed to the spread of the disease.
2. exposed (E): individuals who have come into contact with infected indiduals at least once. exposed individuals are infected but do not have symptoms and have not been identified as infected. disease is in a latent stage. disease latency is the period of time from time of infection to time of becoming infectious. people go from (S) to (E).
3. infected (I): individuals revealing symptoms and are identified for the infection and have been symptomatically infected. they are infective and spread disease.
4. asymptomatic (A): 
5. quarantined (Q): 
6. fatal (F): 
7. recovered (R): 

this model takes the following parameters:
(N): total population size of country/city/community
