Alright...

after breaking down the paper more heres what I need to know:
(in no particular order)

1. nonlinear ODE (im taking a class this semester for aero mtrl eng so not bad to get a head start
    * this doesnt matter as much cuz of numpy and the different libs you can import
2. Matlab
3. python, numpy, other libs
4. data scurbbing (this is really important, i cant just use whatever data. I have to make sure the data is shitty like false reports etc)

this is a tentative list. ill see what else I need to learn as I go thru with this project lmao.
kinda regretting this a tad I shoulda started with a cool portfolio website with a game and parrallax effect or something that looks fancy. this is gonna be a shitter hah.

now that ive made the basic program for solving the diff equations, i have to collect some data, preprocess it, and optimization.
- this involves normalizing, filtering, and transforming the data.
